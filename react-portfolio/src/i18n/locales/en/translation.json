          "title": "From hospitality to code",
          "content": "I couldnâ€™t imagine that one day Iâ€™ll start a blog and write about my journey of becoming a web developer. (Wellâ€¦ Iâ€™m still an aspiring web developer, but you know what I mean) Itâ€™s been a journey full of challenges, learning, growth and it is by far not the end of it. If youâ€™re considering following this path or you're just curious about the path to becoming a developer, this post is for you. Hospitality is rewarding in its own way - and I still enjoy some part of it until this day. But I started to feel stuck in a routine. Lack of creative challenges and the sense that I wasnâ€™t growing anymore led me to explore other options. Something with computers always clicked with me - little did I know that coding was that much fun. Deciding to learn programming wasnâ€™t easy. Itâ€™s important to note that the decision was personal and not something that people expected of me. I always had a hard time with mathematics and thus always thought that programming shouldnâ€™t be for me because it's full of maths and calculations. Now, there is some truth to that but not every part of web development is calculations. Designing a website has nothing to do with it nor the aesthetic or structure behind.  With every obstacle I faced I became more interested in the topic. That was the turning point where I had a feeling that that is something I want to pursue. Even as a hobby or just in my free time. Learning to code while working is no joke. I was constantly tired. There were nights when I questioned my decisionâ€¦ I learned that persistence is key. I started using online resources such as Codecademy, freeCodeCamp and youtube for support. Also agile project management helped me a lot, to learn that itâ€™s easier to break down a big project into smaller pieces to stay focused. My first big win as a developer was my first website that I created for my portfolio to showcase my skills (atdigitalconsultancy.co.uk). After I finished it I was so proud. The goal of this project was to build an agency that can function later on as a hub for me to conduct business. It was challenging to create something from scratch that I had never done before, but I managed it. Itâ€™s not perfect but in my opinion it is just as good as the other agencies out there. And done is always better than perfect. Iâ€™m currently working as a part-time chef and a freelance web developer, helping individuals and businesses to achieve their goals in the digital field with UX design, web design, web development, and software development. I work mainly with React, HTML, CSS. Freelancing allows me to apply what Iâ€™ve learned to real-world problems while continuously growing skills. Iâ€™m currently diving deeper into backend development to become a full-stack developer. My goal is to eventually work as a developer at a company that values creativity, or perhaps expand my freelancing to include consulting.",
